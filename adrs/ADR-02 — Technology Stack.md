# ADR-002: Web-Based Technology Stack

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The CMS proof of concept requires a modern, widely supported technology stack that allows rapid development and aligns with industry standards.

## Decision
The system uses a web-based stack consisting of a frontend web application, a backend REST API, and a relational database.

## Alternatives Considered
- Desktop application: Rejected due to limited accessibility.
- Mobile-only solution: Rejected as it does not cover all user roles effectively.

## Consequences
This approach enables accessibility across devices, supports future expansion, and aligns with the system’s web-based architecture diagrams.
